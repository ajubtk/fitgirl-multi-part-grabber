# fitgirl-multi-part-grabber

<br><br>
  _Do you use fuckingfast to download fitgirl files?_
  
  _Are you tired of clicking multiple links for each file parts?_
  
  _I came with a solution for this problem. Through this project, I created a python application to automatically collect the DIRECT LINKS for all the parts of the game._  
  
  _This application stores all the collected links in a TEXT FILE and you can import this text file to your IDM software to download all the parts as batches._

<br><br>

**<h2>What's New</h2>**

- Added a new GUI to the application.
- Added a new field to providee the name of the game and store the text file along with game name.
- Made more easy to use.
